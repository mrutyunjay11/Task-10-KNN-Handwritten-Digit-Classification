# Task 10 – KNN: Handwritten Digit Classification

## Internship: AI & ML Internship

### Objective
To classify handwritten digits using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with proper feature scaling and K-value tuning.

---

## Dataset
Sklearn Digits Dataset  
Loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_digits()`.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Dataset loading and inspection
2. Visualization of sample digits
3. Train-test split
4. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
5. KNN training with K=3
6. K-value tuning (3,5,7,9)
7. Accuracy vs K analysis
8. Confusion matrix visualization
9. Final output prediction visualization

---

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook
- Accuracy vs K plot
- Confusion matrix

---

## Final Outcome
Understanding of distance-based classification and K tuning in KNN.
